# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a comprehensive database structure and seeders for a Material Management and Destruction System (UPP Material) that tracks material movement from central office to regions and plants (SPBE/BPT), with proper audit trails and material destruction processes, following the specified PRD requirements.

## Key Knowledge
- **Database Structure**: 8 main tables - regions, plants, items, destination_sales, initial_stocks, current_stocks, destruction_submissions, transaction_logs
- **Location Handling**: Removed confusing `lokasi_type` columns from `current_stocks` and `transaction_logs` tables - now using direct `lokasi_id` that can reference either regions or plants
- **Standardized Regions**: Pusat (P.Layang), SA Jambi, SA Bengkulu, SA Lampung, SA Bangsel, SA Sumsel
- **Plant Types**: SPBE (Stasiun Pengisian Bahan Bakar Elpiji) and BPT (Bulk Plant Terminal)
- **Material Categories**: Baik, Baru, Rusak, Afkir
- **Transaction Types**: Penerimaan, Penyaluran, Transaksi Sales, Pemusnahan
- **Status Flow**: Destruction submissions follow PROSES → DONE → DITOLAK workflow
- **Foreign Key Strategy**: Complex relationships handled with separate migration for foreign keys to avoid circular dependencies

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Created 9 migration files in proper dependency order (000010-000018)
- [DONE] Developed comprehensive seeder with realistic regional and plant data
- [DONE] Implemented simplified location system (removed `lokasi_type` columns)
- [DONE] Successfully ran `migrate:fresh --seed` with no errors
- [DONE] Verified database structure matches PRD specifications
- [DONE] Identified that business logic for status change automation (DONE status → transaction log creation → stock reduction) needs to be implemented separately in application code

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Database structure implementation
- [DONE] Data seeding with standardized regions and plants
- [DONE] Migration order optimization to avoid foreign key conflicts
- [TODO] Implement application business logic to handle status changes in destruction_submissions (when status becomes DONE, create transaction log and reduce stock)
- [TODO] Create backend functionality for the complete workflow (application layer)
