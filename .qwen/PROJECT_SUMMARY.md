# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Build and modernize the Clean & Clear Warehouse Management System with a robust API layer using token-based authentication, while maintaining existing web functionality and implementing a new database structure with proper relationships.

## Key Knowledge

### Technology Stack
- Laravel 12 framework with Sanctum for API authentication
- PHP 8.2+
- MySQL database with structured migrations
- Postman for API testing and documentation
- Laravel permissions package for role-based access control
- Excel export capabilities

### Database Structure
- **8 Core Models**: Region, Plant, Item, DestinationSale, InitialStock, CurrentStock, TransactionLog, DestructionSubmission
- **Complete Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints and model relationships
- **API-First Approach**: All models include API-ready methods and scopes

### Key Files & Configurations
- `routes/api.php` - Contains API routes using new models directly in closures
- `postman_collection.json` - Updated with token-based authentication
- New model files in `app/Models/` with proper relationships
- Database migrations for all 8 models with foreign key relationships

### Authentication System
- Sanctum token-based authentication implemented
- Login endpoint returns API token and user data
- All protected API endpoints require Bearer token
- Logout endpoint revokes the current token

## Recent Actions

### Accomplishments
✅ **[DONE]** Database structure designed with 8 core models and proper relationships  
✅ **[DONE]** All database migrations created and executed  
✅ **[DONE]** New models implemented with relationships, scopes, and methods  
✅ **[DONE]** API routes updated to use new models directly  
✅ **[DONE]** Laravel Sanctum installed and configured for token authentication  
✅ **[DONE]** Postman collection updated with token-based authentication flow  
✅ **[DONE]** Complete API documentation created for Postman collection  

### Key Changes Made
- Updated `routes/api.php` to use Sanctum middleware (`auth:sanctum`) instead of session auth
- Modified login route to generate Sanctum API tokens
- Modified logout route to revoke Sanctum tokens
- Updated check-auth route to work with Sanctum authentication
- Added `HasApiTokens` trait to User model
- Created comprehensive Postman collection with automated token management

### Discoveries
- System was in transition state with legacy controllers still using old models
- New models have superior relationship structure and API-ready methods
- API routing uses direct model calls in closures rather than traditional controller methods
- Web interface controllers still need migration to use new models

## Current Plan

1. **[DONE]** Database foundation with 8 core models and relationships
2. **[DONE]** API authentication system with Laravel Sanctum
3. **[DONE]** Postman collection and API documentation
4. **[TODO]** Migrate existing web controllers from old models to new models
5. **[TODO]** Update views to work with new model structure
6. **[TODO]** Complete integration of new model system throughout application

The system is currently in a stable transition state where the API layer is fully modernized with the new model structure and token authentication, while the web interface controllers still use the legacy model structure.
